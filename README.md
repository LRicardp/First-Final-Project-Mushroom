# First-Final-Project-Mushroom
This is my first final group project from Introduction to Data Science course in my college

The data is from Kaggle.com. The project was about clustering mushrooms into poisonous and edible instead of classifying them. It is found that the data is a categorical type and contains 23 variables. Because this project used clusterization, it is necessary to encode the data and remove the "Class" and "Veil.Type" data columns. 

The following interpretation can be taken from the output:
1. From those 1936 observations, 192 corresponded to the original "E" (edible) label and 1744 corresponded to the original "P" (poisonous) label. So that this cluster can be categorized as a cluster that describes a type of poisonous mushroom.
2. Of the 6188 observations, 4016 correspond to the original "E" (edible) label and 2172 correspond to the original "P" (poisonous) label. This cluster includes types of mushrooms that have a combination of edible and poisonous types.
3. The accuracy of the cluster analysis process is 27.3%

The writer clearly understands that this project is far from ideal, therefore any critics and recommendations are welcome.

All members of this group project are from Universitas Udayana majoring in Mathematics Studies, which are:
